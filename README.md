# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Curriculum
A curriculum and a roadmap for Machine Learning and Deep Learning from Zero to Hero. This curriculum will help anyone who wants to master Machine Learning and Deep Learning which is a subset of Machine Learning from the scratch even if the learner is not familiar with Mathematics.

## Week 1:
### 1. Linear Algebra

(a) If you want a easy to follow and grasp the understanding of Linear Algebra quickly with a great intuition, I recommend you to watch the Essence of Linear Algebra series of Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown YouTube channel):

(b) If you want a in-depth explation and problem solving course, obviously it's MIT Open Courseware's Linear Algebra by [Prof. Gilbert Strang](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/)

(c) If you're not from Mathematics background, obviously you have to visit [Khan Academy.](https://www.khanacademy.org/) It may take 2-3 weeks if you're a complete beginer. I would suggest to watch the videos by 1.x speed to complete them quickly.
